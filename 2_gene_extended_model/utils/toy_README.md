This simulation will be made with overly simplistic parameters in order to get an int    uition for how this system evolves.

There will be very few codon choices, probably only two. (fast and slow)
There will be three parameters that I adjust:
		1) Ratio of speeds for the fast and slow codons
		2) Ribosome pool size
	    3) Ratio of scoring weight for translation efficiency/expression error
I will start the simulation with one gene. [done]

Next, genes of varying lengths. Some large and some small.
